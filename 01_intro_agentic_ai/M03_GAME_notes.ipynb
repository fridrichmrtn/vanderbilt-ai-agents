    "### Motivating Example: The Proactive Coder\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how the GAME framework applies in practice, consider an AI agent designed to proactively enhance a codebase. This Proactive Coder agent will scan a repository, analyze patterns in the code, and propose potential new features that it could implement with a small number of changes. If the user approves a feature, the agent will generate the initial implementation and suggest refinements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the GAME framework, we break down the agent design:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals (What to achieve):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify potential enhancements\n",
    "* Make sure that the enhancements are helpful and relevant\n",
    "* Make sure that the enhancements are small and self-contained so that they can be implemented by the agent with minimal risk\n",
    "* Ensure that the changes do not break existing interfaces\n",
    "* Ensure that the agent only implements features that the user agrees to\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions (How to achieve it):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pick a random file in the code base and read through it\n",
    "* Read some related files to the original file\n",
    "* Read at most 5 files\n",
    "* Propose three feature ideas that are implementable in 2–3 functions and require minimal editing of the existing code\n",
    "* Ask the user to select which feature to implement\n",
    "* List the files that will need to be edited and provide a list of proposed changes for each\n",
    "* Go file by file implementing the changes until they are all edited\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "* List project files\n",
    "* Read project file\n",
    "* Ask user to select a feature\n",
    "* Edit project file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a simple conversational memory and store the complete contents of files in the conversation for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide simple implementations of the actions in Python to run locally, but could later change to an implementation that works in GitHub Actions.\n",

    "#### Testing Agent Designs Through Conversation Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing code, test whether the GAME design is feasible by simulating the agent’s decision-making in a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT). Early simulation exposes design flaws when they’re easiest to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why Simulate First\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a dress rehearsal, simulation ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goals are achievable with planned actions\n",
    "* Memory requirements are reasonable\n",
    "* Available actions are sufficient\n",
    "* The agent can decide effectively with the given information\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Setting Up a Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a chat with a prompt defining goals and actions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I'd like to simulate an AI agent that I'm designing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "* Find potential code enhancements\n",
    "* Ensure changes are small and self-contained\n",
    "* Get user approval before making changes\n",
    "* Maintain existing interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions available:\n",
    "* list_project_files()\n",
    "* read_project_file(filename)\n",
    "* ask_user_approval(proposal)\n",
    "* edit_project_file(filename, changes)\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, output an action to take. \n",
    "Stop and wait; I will type in the result of the action as my next message.\n",
    "Ask me for the first task to perform.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observing Agent Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin with a small project and watch the agent’s approach. Does it list files first or immediately read one? Adjust how you present results—extra metadata (e.g., file counts) can improve its choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evolving Tools and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation reveals unclear tool descriptions or vague goals. Refine them, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "read_project_file(filename) -> Returns the content of a Python file. \n",
    "Filename must be from list_project_files().\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals may also need tightening, such as specifying “improve error handling and input validation.”\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understanding Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chat exchange mirrors an agent-loop memory entry. Monitoring how much history the model can handle clarifies memory needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learning from Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce errors or malformed data to test recovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"error\": \"FileNotFoundError: main.py does not exist\"}\n",
    "{\"cont3nt\": \"def broken_func(): pass\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe if the agent stays goal-focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Preventing Runaway Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with stop criteria—e.g., limit number of files read or improvements proposed—without risking infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rapid Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation lets you test many scenarios quickly, such as large projects or complex code, before implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gathering Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, ask the agent for feedback: missing tools, unclear instructions, vague goals. Its reflections can guide design improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Building an Example Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Save good and bad exchanges to refine prompts and create test cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Good:* Agent reads a file before editing and proposes specific improvements.\n",
    "*Poor:* Agent edits files without prior analysis or user approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through repeated simulation and refinement, you gain a clear picture of real-world agent behavior, leading to more robust and well-aligned implementations.\n"
