Introduction\\nImagine a scenario where you just started an A/B test that will be running for the next two weeks. However, after just a day or two, it is becoming increasingly clear that version A is working better for certain types of users, whereas version B is working better for another set of users. You think to yourself: Perhaps I should re-route the traffic such that users are getting more of the version that is benefiting them more, and less of the other version. Is there a principled way to achieve this?\\n\\nContextual bandits are a class of one-step reinforcement learning algorithms specifically designed for such treatment personalization problems where we would like to dynamically adjust traffic based on which treatment is working for whom. Despite being incredibly powerful in what they can achieve, they are one of the lesser known methods in Data Science, and I hope that this post will give you a comprehensive introduction to this amazing topic. Without further ado, let’s dive right in!\\n\\n2. When To Use Contextual Bandits\\nIf you are just getting started with contextual bandits, it can be confusing to understand how contextual bandits are related to other more widely known methods such as A/B testing, and why you might want to use contextual bandits instead of those other methods. Therefore, we start our journey by discussing the similarities and differences between contextual bandits and related methods.\\n\\n2.1. Contextual Bandit vs Multi-Armed Bandit vs A/B Testing\\nLet us start with the most basic A/B testing setting that allocates traffic into treatment and control in a static fashion. For example, a data scientist might decide to run an A/B test for two weeks with 50% of traffic going to treatment and 50% going to control. What this means is that regardless of whether we are on the first day of the test or the last, we will be assigning users to control or treatment with 50% probability.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if the data scientist were to use a multi-armed bandit (MAB) instead of an A/B test in this case, then traffic will be allocated to treatment and control in a dynamic fashion. In other words, traffic allocations in a MAB will change as days go by. For example, if the algorithm decides that treatment is doing better than control on the first day, the traffic allocation can change from 50% treatment and 50% control to 60% treatment vs 40% control on the second day, and so on.\\n\\nDespite allocating traffic dynamically, MAB ignores an important fact, which is that not all users are the same. This means that a treatment that is working for one type of user might not work for another. For example, it might be the case that while treatment is working better for core users, control is actually better for casual users. In this case, even if treatment is better overall, we can actually get more value from our application if we assign more core users to treatment and more casual users to control.\\n\\nThis is exactly where contextual bandits (CB) come in. While MAB simply looks at whether treatment or control is doing better overall, CB focuses on whether treatment or control is doing better for a user with a given set of characteristics. The \"context\" in contextual bandits precisely refers to these user characteristics and is what differentiates it from MAB. For example, CB might decide to increase treatment allocation to 60% for core users but decrease treatment allocation to 40% for casual users after observing first day’s data. In other words, CB will dynamically update traffic allocation taking user characteristics (core vs casual in this example) into account.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the key differences between A/B testing, MAB, and CB, and the figure that follows visualizes these ideas.\\n\\nTable 1: Differences Between A/B Testing, MAB, and CB\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Traffic Allocations in A/B Testing, MAB, and CB\\n\\n\\n2.2. Contextual Bandit vs Multiple MABs\\nAt this point, you might be tempted to think that CB is nothing more than a set of multiple MABs running together. In fact, when the context we are interested in is a small one (e.g., we are only interested in whether a user is a core user or a casual user), we can simply run one MAB for core users and another MAB for casual users. However, as the context gets large (core vs casual, age, country, time since last active, etc.) it becomes impractical to run a separate MAB for each unique context value.\\n\\nThe real value of CB emerges in this case through the use of models to describe the relationship of the experimental conditions in different contexts to our outcome of interest (e.g., conversion). As opposed to enumerating through each context value and treating them independently, the use of models allows us to share information from different contexts and makes it possible to handle large context spaces. This idea of a model will be discussed at several different points in this post, so keep on reading to learn more.\\n\\n2.3. Contextual Bandit vs Multi-Step Reinforcement Learning\\nThe introduction referred to CB as a class of one-step reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. So, what exactly is the difference between one-step and multi-step RL? And what makes CB one-step? The fundamental difference between CB and multi-step RL is that in CB we assume the actions the algorithm takes (e.g., serve treatment or control to a specific user) don’t affect the future states of the overall system. In other words, the state (or \"context\" as is more appropriately called in CB) affects what action we take, but that action we took does not in turn impact or change the state. The following figure summarizes this distinction.\\n\\nFigure 2: Contextual Bandit vs Multi-Step RL\\n\\nImage by author, inspired by source\\nImage by author, inspired by source\\nA few examples should make this distinction clearer. Let’s say that we are building a system to decide what ads to show to users based on their age. We would expect that users from different age groups may find different ads more relevant to them, which means that a user’s age should affect what ads we should show them. However, the ad we showed them doesn’t in turn affect their age, so the one-step assumption of CB seems to hold. However, if we move one step further and find out that serving expensive ads deplete our inventory (and limit which ads we can serve in the future) or that the ad we show today affect whether the user will visit our site again, then the one-step assumption is indirectly inviolated, so we may want to consider developing a full-blown RL system instead.\\n\\nA note of caution though: While multi-step reinforcement learning is more flexible compared to contextual bandits, it’s also more complicated to implement. So, if the problem at hand can be accurately framed as a one-step problem (even though it looks like a multi-step problem at first glance), contextual bandits could be the more practical approach.\\n\\n2.4. Contextual Bandit vs Uplift Modeling\\nBefore moving on to discussing different CB algorithms, I would also like to briefly touch upon the connection between CB and uplift modeling. An uplift model is usually built on top of A/B test data to discover the relationship between the treatment effect (uplift) and user characteristics. The results from such a model can then be used to personalize treatments in the future. For example, if the uplift model discovers that certain users are more likely to benefit from a treatment, then only those types of users might be given the treatment in the future.\\n\\nGiven this description of uplift modeling, it should be clear that both CB and uplift modeling are solutions to the personalization problem. The key difference between them is that CB approaches this problem in a more dynamic way in the sense that personalization happens on-the-fly instead of waiting for results from an A/B test. At a conceptual level, CB can very loosely be thought of as A/B testing and uplift modeling happening concurrently instead of sequentially. Given the focus of this post, I won’t be discussing uplift modeling further, but there are several great resources to learn more about it such as [1].\\n\\n3. Exploration and Exploitation in Contextual Bandits\\nAbove we discussed how CB dynamically allocates traffic depending on whether treatment or control is doing better for a given group of users at a given point in time. This raises an important question: How aggressive do we want to be when we are making these traffic allocation changes? For example, if after just one day of data we decide that treatment is working better for users from the US, should we completely stop serving control to US users?\\n\\nI’m sure most of you would agree that this would be a bad idea, and you would be correct. The main problem with changing traffic allocations this aggressively is that making inferences based on insufficient amounts of data can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, it might be that the first day of data we gathered is actually not representative of dormant users and that in reality control is better for them. If we stop serving control to US users after the first day, we will never be able to learn this correct relationship.\\n\\nA better approach to dynamically updating traffic allocations is striking the right balance between exploitation (serve the best experimental condition based on the data so far) and exploration (continue to serve other experimental conditions as well). Continuing with the previous example, if data from the first day indicate that treatment is better for US users, we can serve treatment to these users with an increased probability the next day while still allocating a reduced but non-zero fraction to control.\\n\\nThere are numerous exploration strategies used in CB (and MAB) as well as several variations of them that try to strike this right balance between exploration and exploitation. Three popular strategies include ε-greedy, upper confidence bound, and Thompson sampling.\\n\\n3.1. ε-greedy\\nIn this strategy, we first decide which experimental condition is doing better for a given group of users at a given point in time. The simplest way to do this is by comparing the average target values (y) for each experimental condition for these users. More formally, we can decide the \"winning\" condition for a group of users by finding the condition d that has the higher value for\\n\\n\\nwhere _ndx is the number of samples we have so far from users in condition d with context x, and _yidx is the target value for a given sample i in condition d with context x.\\n\\nAfter deciding which experimental condition is currently \"best\" for these users, we serve them that condition with 1-ε probability (where ε is usually a small number such as 0.05) and serve a random experimental condition with probability ε. In reality, we might want to dynamically update our ε such that it is large at the beginning of the experiment (when more exploration is needed) and gradually gets smaller as we collect more and more data.\\n\\nAdditionally, context X might be high-dimensional (country, gender, platform, tenure, etc.) so we might want to use a model to get these y estimates to deal with the curse of dimensionality. Formally, the condition to serve can be decided by finding the condition d that has the higher value for\\n\\n\\nwhere x^T is an m-dimensional row-vector of context values and _θd is an m-dimensional column-vector of learnable parameters associated with condition d.\\n\\n3.2. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)\\nThis strategy decides the next condition to serve by looking at not only which condition has a higher y estimate but also our precision of (or confidence in) that estimate. In a simple MAB setting, precision can be thought to be a function of how many times a given condition has already been served so far. In particular, a condition that (i) has a high average y (so it makes sense to exploit) or (ii) has not yet been served many times (so it needs more exploration) is more likely to be served next.\\n\\nWe can generalize this idea to the CB setting by keeping track of how many times different conditions are served in different contexts. Assuming a simple setting with a low-dimensional context X such that CB can be thought of as just multiple MABs running together, we can select the next condition to serve based on which condition d has the higher value for\\n\\n\\nwhere c is some constant (to be selected based on how much emphasis we want to put on the precision of our estimate when exploring) and _nx is the number of times context x is seen so far.\\n\\nHowever, in most cases, the context X will be high-dimensional, which means that just like in the ε-greedy case, we would need to make use of a model. In this setting, a condition d can be served next if it has the higher value for\\n\\n\\nwhere SE(.) is the standard error of our estimate (or more generally a metric that quantifies our current level of confidence in that estimate).\\n\\nNote that there are several versions of UCB, so you will likely come across different formulas. A popular UCB method is LinUCB that formalizes the problem in a linear model framework (e.g., [2]).\\n\\n3.3. Thompson Sampling\\nThe third and final exploration strategy to be discussed is Thompson sampling, which is a Bayesian approach to solving the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Here, we have a model f(D, X; Θ) that returns predicted y values given experimental condition D, context X, and some set of learnable parameters Θ. This function gives us access to posterior distributions of expected y values for any condition-context pair, thus allowing us to choose the next condition to serve according to the probability that it yields the highest expected y given context. Thompson sampling naturally balances exploration and exploitation as we are sampling from the posterior and updating our model based on the observations. To make these ideas more concrete, here are the steps involved in Thompson sampling:\\n\\n\\nIn practice, instead of having a single function we can also use a different function for each experimental condition (e.g., evaluate both _f_c(X; Θc) and _f_t(X; Θt) and then select the condition with the higher value). Furthermore, the update step usually takes place not after each sample but rather after seeing a batch of samples. For more details on Thompson sampling, you can refer to [3] [4].\\n\\n4. Contextual Bandit Algorithm Steps\\nThe previous section (especially the part on Thompson sampling) should already give you a pretty good sense of the steps involved in a CB algorithm. However, for the sake of completeness, here is a step-by-step description of a standard CB algorithm:\\n\\nA new data point arrives with context X (e.g., a core user with an iOS device in the US).\\nGiven this data point and the exploration strategy chosen (e.g., ε-greedy), the algorithm decides on a condition to serve this user (e.g., treatment or control).\\nAfter the condition is served, we observe the outcome y (e.g., whether the user made a purchase or not).\\nUpdate (or fully retrain) the model used in Step 2 after seeing the new data. (As mentioned previously, we usually make an update not after every sample but after seeing a batch of samples to ensure that updates are less noisy.)\\nRepeat.\\n5. Offline Policy Evaluation in Contextual Bandits\\nSo far we have only discussed how to implement a CB algorithm as new data come in. An equally important topic to cover is how to evaluate a CB algorithm using old (or logged) data. This is called offline evaluation or offline policy evaluation (OPE).\\n\\n5.1. OPE Using Causal Inference Methods\\nOne way to do OPE is using well-known causal inference techniques such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) or the Doubly Robust (DR) method. Causal inference is appropriate here because we are essentially trying to estimate the counterfactual of what would have happened if a different policy served a different condition to a user. There is already a great Medium article on this topic [5], so here I will only briefly summarize the main idea from that piece and adapt it to our discussion.\\n\\nTaking IPS as an example, doing OPE usually requires us to know not only (i) the probability of assigning a given condition to a sample using our new CB algorithm but also (ii) the probability with which a given condition was assigned to a sample in the logged data. Take the following hypothetical logged data with _X_1-X3 being context, D being the experimental condition, _PO(D) being the probability of assigning D to that user, and y being the outcome.\\n\\nTable 2: Example Logged Data From An A/B Test\\n\\n\\nAs you can see, in this example _PO(D) is always 0.6 for D=1 and 0.4 for D=0 regardless of the context, so the logged data can be assumed to come from an A/B test that assigns treatment with probability 0.6. Now, if we want to test how a CB algorithm would have performed had we assigned conditions using a CB algorithm rather than a simple A/B test, we can use the following formula to get the IPS estimate of the cumulative y for CB\\n\\n\\nwhere n is the number of samples in the logged data (which is 5 here) and _P_N(Di) is the probability of serving the logged D for _useri had we used the new CB algorithm instead (this probability will depend on the specific algorithm being evaluated).\\n\\nOnce we have this estimate, we can compare that to the observed cumulative y from the old A/B test (which is 1+0+0+1+1=3 here) to decide if the CB would have yielded a higher cumulative y.\\n\\nFor more information on OPE using causal inference methods, please refer to the article linked at the beginning of the section. The article also links to a nice GitHub repo with lots of OPE implementations.\\n\\nA side note here is that this section discussed causal inference methods only as a technique used in OPE. However, in reality, one can also apply them while the CB algorithm is being run so as to \"debias\" the training data that the algorithm collects along the way. The reason why we might want to apply methods such as IPS to our training data is that the CB policy that generates this data is a non-uniform random policy by definition, so estimating causal effects from it to decide what action to take would benefit from using causal inference methods. If you would like to learn more about debiasing, please refer to [6].\\n\\n5.2. OPE Using Sampling Methods\\nAnother way to do OPE is through the use of sampling methods. In particular, a very simple replay method [7] can be used to evaluate a CB algorithm (or any other algorithm for that matter) using logged data from a randomized policy such as an A/B test. In its simplest form (where we assume a uniform random logging policy), the method works as follows:\\n\\nSample the next user with context X from the logged data.\\nDecide what condition to assign to that user using the new CB algorithm.\\nIf the selected condition matches the actual condition in the logged data, then add the observed y to the cumulative y counter. If it doesn’t match, ignore the sample.\\nRepeat until all samples are considered.\\nIf the logging policy doesn’t assign treatments uniformly at random, then the method needs to be slightly modified. One modification that the authors themselves mention is to use rejection sampling (e.g., [8]) whereby we would accept samples from the majority treatment less often compared to the minority treatment in Step 3. Alternatively, we could consider dividing the observed y by the propensity in Step 3 to similarly \"down-weight\" the more frequent treatment and \"up-weight\" the less frequent one.\\n\\nIn the next section, I employ an even simpler method in my evaluation that uses up- and down-sampling with bootstrap to transform the original non-uniform data into a uniform one and then apply the method as it is.\\n\\n6. Contextual Bandit in Action\\nTo demonstrate contextual bandits in action, I put together a notebook that generates a simulated dataset and compares the cumulative y (or \"reward\") estimates for new A/B, MAB, and CB policies evaluated on this dataset. Many parts of the code in this notebook are taken from the Contextual Bandits chapter of an amazing book on Reinforcement Learning [9] (highly recommended if you would like to dig deeper into Reinforcement Learning using Python) and two great posts by James LeDoux [10] [11] and adapted to the setting we are discussing here.\\n\\nThe setup is very simple: The original data we have comes from an A/B test that assigned treatment to users with probability 0.75 (so not uniformly at random). Using this randomized logged data, we would like to evaluate and compare the following three policies based on their cumulative y:\\n\\nA new A/B policy that randomly assigns treatment to users with probability 0.4.\\nA MAB policy that decides what treatment to assign next using an ε-greedy policy that doesn’t take context X into account.\\nA CB policy that decides what treatment to assign next using an ε-greedy policy that takes context X into account.\\nI modified the original method described in the Li et al. paper such that instead of directly sampling from the simulated data (which is 75% treatment and only 25% control in my example), I first down-sample treatment cases and up-sample control cases (both with replacement) to get a new dataset that is exactly 50% treatment and 50% control.\\n\\nThe reason why I start with a dataset that is not 50% treatment and 50% control is to show that even if the original data doesn’t come from a policy that assigns treatment and control uniformly at random, we can still work with that data to do offline evaluation after doing up- and/or down-sampling to massage it into a 50/50% dataset. As mentioned in the previous section, the logic behind up- and down-sampling is similar to rejection sampling and the related idea of dividing the observed y by the propensity.\\n\\nThe following figure compares the three policies described above (A/B vs MAB vs CB) in terms of their cumulative y values.\\n\\nFigure 3: Cumulative Reward Comparison\\n\\n\\nAs can be seen in this figure, cumulative y increases fastest for CB and slowest for A/B with MAB somewhere in between. While this result is based on a simulated dataset, the patterns observed here can still be generalized. The reason why A/B testing isn’t able to get a high cumulative y is because it isn’t changing the 60/40% allocation at all even after seeing sufficient evidence that treatment is better than control overall. On the other hand, while MAB is able to dynamically update this traffic allocation, it is still performing worse than CB because it isn’t personalizing the treatment vs control assignment based on the context X being observed. Finally, CB is both dynamically changing the traffic allocation and also personalizing the treatment, hence the superior performance.\\n\\n7. Conclusion\\nCongratulations on making it to the end of this fairly long post! We covered a lot of ground related to contextual bandits in this post, and I hope that you leave this page with an appreciation of the usefulness of this fascinating method for online experimentation, especially when treatments need to be personalized.\\n\\nIf you are interested in learning more about contextual bandits (or want to go a step further into multi-step reinforcement learning), I highly recommend the book Mastering Reinforcement Learning with Python by E. Bilgin. The Contextual Bandit chapter of this book was what finally gave me the \"aha!\" moment in understanding this topic, and I kept on reading to learn more about RL in general. As far as offline policy evaluation is concerned, I highly recommend the posts by E. Conti and J. LeDoux, both of which provide great explanations of the techniques involved and provide code examples. Regarding debiasing in contextual bandits, the paper by A. Bietti, A. Agarwal, and J. Langford provides a great overview of the techniques involved. Finally, while this post exclusively focused on using regression models when building contextual bandits, there is an alternative approach called cost-sensitive classification, which you can start learning by checking out these lecture notes by A. Agarwal and S. Kakade [12].\\n\\nHave fun building contextual bandits!\\n\\n8.

This isan open access article underthe CC-BY 4.0 license.DOI: 10.46585/sp30011478editorial.upce.cz/SciPapMartin FridrichBrno University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Management, Institute of Informatics, Czech RepublicPetr DostálBrno University of Technology, Faculty of Business and Management, Institute of Informatics, Czech RepublicAbstractIn e-commerce retail, maintaining a healthy customer base through retention management is necessary. Churnprediction efforts support the goal of retention and rely upon dependent and independent characteristics. Unfortunately,there does not appear to be a consensus regarding a user churn model. Thus, our goal is to propose a model based ona traditional and new set of attributes and explore its properties using auxiliary evaluation. Individual variable importanceis assessed using the best performing modeling pipelines and a permutation procedure. In addition, we estimate theeffects on the performance and quality of a feature set using an original technique based on importance ranking andinformation retrieval. The performance benchmark reveals satisfying pipelines utilizing LR, SVM-RBF, and GBMlearners. The solutions rely profoundly on traditional recency and frequency aspects of user behavior. Interestingly,SVM-RBF and GBM exploit the potential of more subtle elements describing user preferences or date-time behaviouralpatterns. The collected evidence may also aid business decision-making associated with churn prediction efforts, e.g.,retention campaign design.KeywordsUser Model, Churn Prediction, Customer Relationship Management, Electronic Commerce, Retail, Machine Learning,Feature Importance, Feature Set ImportanceJEL ClassificationC60, M31IntroductionDuring the last two decades, the unprecedented growth of the retail e-commerce industry has created a competitiveenvironment built upon immense technological advances and a user-centric paradigm (MacKenzie et al., 2013;Morgan, 2018; Terdiman, 2018). It has become essential for organizations to sustain a valuable user/customerbase. Churn mitigation is principally motivated by a disparity among the unitary costs of user acquisition andretention (Gronwald, 2017); however, there are additional benefits (Ascarza et al., 2018).The retention strategy is arranged into short- and long-term pursuits (Mezghani et al., 2012; Ascarza et al., 2018).In the short term, companies aim to capture behavioural and transactional dynamics to identify users at imminentrisk of churning and preserve them if profitable. In the long term, firms lean towards enhancing customer satisfactionand loyalty through understanding the drivers of churn. Nevertheless, the success of both pursuits is highlydependent on appropriate representation. Brusilovsky (1996) proposes a user model concept to describe userfeatures such as behavior, goals, knowledge, stereotypes, and preferences linked to practical actions. Its qualitycan be assessed indirectly with machine learning methods. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus on auser/customer churn model concerning both explanatory and explained characteristics.Hence, we aim to propose a user churn model for e-commerce retail and explore its properties using indirectevaluation. The rest of the article is structured as follows: the research literature concerning the user model,modeling, and evaluation is covered in the second section. The user churn model is introduced and reviewed inthe third section. The following part defines the dataset, approach to predictive modeling, and performanceevaluation. Furthermore, the fourth section details feature and feature set assessment methods. The fifth sectionoutlines the collected outcomes critically examined in the last part of the paper.\\nPage 2\\n2 SciPap 30(1)Literature ReviewTo outline the relevant research endeavours, we concentrate on peer-reviewed articles from the Web of Scienceand Scopus databases, dealing with user/customer churn in the e-commerce environment (see Table 1). Thestudies determine customer churn in non-contractual settings analytically, and neither probability models (Fader etal., 2005; Netzer et al., 2008) nor cost-benefit frameworks (Glady et al., 2009; Clemente-Císcar et al., 2014) areemployed. Gordini and Veglio (2017), Li and Li (2019), Chou and Chuang (2018), and Llave Montinel and López(2020) use the subsequent periods without financial transactions to ascertain customer churn events. Rachid et al.(2018) extend this notion by combining defection levels with changes in transactional behavior. However, Abbasiet al. (2015), Lee et al. (2018), Rothmeier et al. (2020), and Berger and Kompan (2019) recognize the churn eventin the e-commerce domain as dropping out of the buying process or defecting across web or game sessions.Gordini and Veglio (2017) and Li and Li (2019) deem transactional features (e.g., last transaction date, number offinancial transactions, total revenue) the most relevant and completely omit the domain-specific ones. By contrast,Rachid et al. (2018), Berger and Kompan (2019), Rothmeier et al. (2020), and Perisic and Pahor (2021) show thatthe combination of transactional and behavior/usage (e.g., number of sessions, session length, conversion rate)can significantly improve the predictive performance of the model. Other appealing characteristics, such asperceptional features (Almuqren et al., 2021), decision stages (Abbasi et al., 2015), or geospatial patterns (LlaveMontinel and López, 2020), are included. However, the evidence of their importance may be anecdotal.The building blocks of the modeling pipeline involve data processing, sampling, dimensionality reduction, ormodeling and evaluation, depending on the researcher\\'s objectives. Nonetheless, most articles concentrate on thelast step, favouring a train–test split experimental design and confusion matrix-based performance metrics (Yu etal., 2011; Kim and Lee, 2012; Abbasi et al., 2015; Llave Montinel and López, 2020, Chou and Chuang, 2018;Almuqren et al., 2021). The prevalent classification algorithms include logistic regression (LR), support vectormachine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and meta-learners.Table 1.

(2014) anduse the accessible, fundamental attributes while maximizing the model\\'s predictive power. We form the modelaround user-item interactions, data generally available to any e-commerce retail store.The churn event (dependent variable) is characterized as interaction/no interaction with the e-commerce websiteduring the subsequent month; thus, the explained variable is binary. This interpretation allows us to reflect on onlinebehavior over a considerable period. Other works define churn ordinarily as transactional (Gordini and Veglio,2017; Li and Li, 2019) or employing real-time interactions (Abbasi et al., 2015; Berger and Kompan, 2019).\\nPage 3\\n3 SciPap 30(1)The user model (independent variables) consists of six sets of attributes: recency, frequency, monetary, categoryand item, date–time, and other characteristics (see Table 2). The first three sets cover established behaviouralperspectives. Hughes (2012) describes them as Recency—the time since the last transaction, where a short spanindicates a high probability of returning customer; Frequency—the number of transactions within a period, wherehigh frequency corresponds to increased loyalty; and Monetary—the total revenue within a period, where highspending marks high valued customers. We extend the outlined notions to the online environment with session-and interaction-level features. The scarcity of purchasing data also drives this shift. Matching dimensions arepresent across all reviewed articles. Gordini and Veglio (2017) and Li and Li (2019) acknowledge that transactionalcharacteristics are the most influential. On the other hand, Berger and Kompan (2019) and Rachid et al. (2018)demonstrate that the amalgam of transactional and e-commerce behavior/usage leads to notable gains inclassification performance.Category & item set aims to capture a user\\'s preference. Interest in a vast range of products may be a sign of aloyal customer (Mozer et al., 2000); issues in a particular category, on the other hand, may lead to customerdefection (Buckinx and Dirk, 2005). While research endeavors support categorical behavior (Gordini and Veglio,2017), its impact on user/customer churn in the online context seems understudied.Date & time attributes reflect the prospect of a different user experience level during the day (Buckinx and Dirk,2005), e.g., peaking URL requests during noon may lead to an inadequate response time and worsen theexperience. Berger and Kompan (2019) consider comparable attributes for real-time sessions; however, theauthors do not evaluate the variable\\'s importance directly.Others include time-to-event features and average session length. We expect a long session or a short timebetween interactions to indicate a more engaged user. Again, Berger and Kompan (2019) introduce a similarperspective.Table 2.

Furthermore, we accompany the work with code and data repositories to ensure transparency andreproducibility; see the Supplementary section.Fig. 1. Lower triangular matrix of Pearson\\'s correlation coefficients within the user churn model.Source: AuthorsDatasetWe introduce an open e-commerce retail dataset based on the Retail Rocket Dataset. It covers the period of2015/05/09–2015/09/17 and consists of 49,358 observations, 47 user model vectors, and the churn event. Thetarget class distribution is imbalanced, with a churn rate of ~89%.Further univariate exploratory analysis reveals that most attributes are asymmetric and suffer from outliers;Monetary and Category & item characteristics exhibit sparsity. The multivariate investigation revealsmulticollinearity inside the user churn model; see the lower triangular matrix of Pearson\\'s correlation coefficients in\\nPage 5\\n5 SciPap 30(1)Figure 1. The elements are sorted using agglomerative clustering with Ward linkage, which allows us to seeunderlying groups of associated features, e.g., the light triangle in the upper-left corner represents a coherentcluster of positively correlated features, which establishes a weak negative association with the lower-right set offeatures, including the target class. See the Supplementary Materials section for further details.Modeling PipelineData ProcessingThe transformation steps ordinarily ascertain that the basic assumptions of the downstream techniques aresatisfied. Following the exploratory analysis, we concentrate on the explanatory variables. We impute missingvalues, omit the vectors with near-zero variance, and add a second-degree polynomial expansion to reduce thebias. Furthermore, we approach the disparity in unit measurements and irregularity in the shape of the observedprobability distributions with a uniform quantile transformation.Feature ExtractionTo mitigate multicollinearity and sparsity amongst the explanatory variables, we apply the principal componentanalysis technique to project the processed data into orthonormal 50-dimensional space while capturing the mostvariability. Additional benefits may include improvements in the predictive performance and generalization andreductions in computational runtime and memory requirements (Aggarwal, 2014).ModelingThere is a substantial amount of research devoted to the algorithm selection problem. Nevertheless, we decidedto employ classification methods prevalent in the user/customer churn domain (see Table 1). For the most part, weuse out-of-the-box implementations and hyperparameter settings hinged on the scikit-learn library (Pedregosa etal., 2011), with SVMs being an exception (see Table 3).Table 3.

The modeling pipeline is instantiated and fitted using thetraining split, and its performance is assessed on both data partitions. The procedure is repeated until each splitacts as a validation set; intermediate pipeline and outcomes are collected and stored.\\nPage 6\\n6 SciPap 30(1)Fig. 2. Performance benchmark experimental design.Source: AuthorsClassification MetricsWe assess the classification capabilities with well-known confusion-matrix-based and subjective independentmeasures. We select Accuracy for its comprehensibility and reflect on the distribution imbalance in the target classwith the F1 score (harmonic mean of the Precision & Recall). Furthermore, we select the threshold-independentArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve. This metric describes the probability that randomly drawnmembers of the retained class will produce a lower churn score than randomly drawn churners. More specifically,let us have a class membership score 𝑠 = 𝑠(𝑥), as a function of user model vector 𝑥; the probability density functionof corresponding scores 𝑓𝑘(𝑠), with a cumulative distribution 𝐹𝑘(𝑠), and classes 𝑘 𝜖 {0,1}; then,𝐴𝑈𝐶 = ∫ 𝐹0(𝑠)𝑓1(𝑠)𝑑𝑠.∞−∞(1)Thus, it reflects on the learner\\'s ranking capacity. However, AUC also suffers from a few conceptualshortcomings (Hand, 2009).Feature ImportanceThis article strives to assess individual feature importance and feature set importance. To address the former, weuse the permutation technique Breiman (2001) proposed. It measures the variation in the performance of themodeling solution when a feature is randomly reordered. We construct the empirical probability distribution for eachexplanatory variable using twenty validation splits and ten repeated permutations.We propose an original approach based on the information retrieval theory to address the latter. We treat eachfeature set as retrieved documents and the most influential features identified in the previous step as relevantdocuments, which allows us to evaluate the set importance using the following. Let us have a set of features G anda set of the n most influential features 𝐹𝑛; then,𝑃𝑅𝐸𝐺 = |𝐺 ∩ 𝐹𝑛||𝐺| , (2)𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐺 = |𝐺 ∩ 𝐹𝑛|𝑛 , (3)𝐹𝛽𝐺 = (1 + 𝛽2) ∙ 𝑃𝑅𝐸𝐺 ∙ 𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐺(𝛽2 ∙ 𝑃𝑅𝐸𝐺 ) + 𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐺, (4)where 𝑃𝑅𝐸𝐺 indicates the proportion of the relevant features within the set; 𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐺 shows the ratio of the influentialelements captured; 𝐹𝛽𝐺 allows us to combine both perspectives with the weighted harmonic mean. We considerthe ten most influential features and apply a non-preferential variant of 𝐹𝛽𝐺 , with 𝛽 = 1. As a result, we can composeempirical probability distributions for the information retrieval measures. In addition, we introduce their referentialcounterparts based on 10,000 random permutations in the feature importance rank.ResultsThis section centres around (1) classification performance and runtimes and (2) individual and set feature\\nPage 7\\n7 SciPap 30(1)importance. We analyse the modeling pipelines and choose the most suitable ones for the feature permutationassessment, which is the article\\'s main focus. The analysis is supported by estimates of central tendencies,confidence bounds, and hypothesis testing with Bonferroni corrections on untreated 𝛼 = 0.01.Performance BenchmarkWe compare the prediction ability of the modeling pipelines using the mean point estimates of the classificationmetrics and confidence bounds for the underlying distributions in Table 4. In addition, we evaluate the differencein performance for each combination of pipelines using a paired t-test coupled with validation splits. The nullhypothesis claims that the true difference in sample means equals zero; the alternative hypothesis states that theactual difference in sample means is not equal to zero, i.e., there is a statistically significant difference inclassification performance between the two solutions.Table 4.

We fail to reject the null hypothesis for the pairs and metrics,i.e., there does not seem to be enough evidence to distinguish between the solutions. The outcomes of subject-independent AUC are more diverse, with GBM achieving the highest value. We still fail to reject the null hypothesisfor associations amongst LR, SVM-RBF, and GBM. The remaining solutions do not perform well; the gap isstatistically significant and aligned with acceptance of the alternative hypothesis in most (RF) or all pairedcomparisons (MLP).Fig. 3. Bias and variance trade-off in AUC.Source: Authors\\nPage 8\\n8 SciPap 30(1)To understand the underwhelming performance of RF and MLP, we present the bias-variance trade-off plot inFigure 3, concentrating on AUC on both seen and unseen data. We recognize that both algorithms exhibitoutstanding classification ability on training splits (low bias); however, they fail to generalize on validation splits(high variance). In other words, their out-of-the-box hyperparameter settings lead to unreasonably complex models.Nonetheless, hyperparameter optimization is beyond the scope of this article.The disparities in computational runtime reveal additional practical insights, i.e., the training LR pipeline is fasterthan GBM by a factor of ~16 while yielding equivalent classification performance. In addition, we see that theNystroem kernel mapping (Williams and Seeger, 2000) improves the training phase of the SVM solution by a factorof ~7. Thus, LR and SVM-RBF may be favoured due to their parsimony and speed.Feature ImportanceOverall, permutation feature importance is evaluated on validation data partitions using the three best-performingsolutions: LR, SVM-RBF, and GBM. The most influential variables are presented in Table 5, with respective meanpoint estimates and confidence bounds. We also verify that the decrease in AUC is positive for all of them with thebootstrap test. Variables ses_rec, ses_rec_avg, and ses_n are indispensable for all three pipelines and are alignedwith our expectations, e.g., we would suspect a user with a recent session, a low average period between sessions,and a high number of sessions to be retained.Table 5.

The results are shown in Table 6, withcorresponding mean estimates and confidence intervals supported by the bootstrap tests. The Recency set exhibitsoutstanding qualities with a very high F1; 65–86 % of its elements are identified as relevant (PRE); modelingsolutions select 33–43 % of the essential characteristics from the Recency set (REC). The Frequency group is therunner-up, with a considerable F1; 36–52% PRE and 25–32% REC in LR and GBM. Category & item and Date &time characteristics display a moderate F1; the former suffers from sparsity (low PRE) and is the essential set forSVM-RBF (high REC); the latter group shows acceptable PRE and is favoured by GBM (fair REC). The remainingfeature sets appear irrelevant for all modeling pipelines; however, we can statistically confirm this only for LR.Table 6.

Gordini andVeglio (2017) and Li and Li (2019) rely on their transactional counterparts. Rachid et al. (2018) depend on featuresdescribing users\\' behavior within a purchasing process. The disparities are driven by churn perception andbusiness context, e.g., the reported studies focus on transactional churn in explained and explanatory variables.Other culprits may include learners, evaluation procedures, or the use of data partitions.Set perspective recognized Recency and Frequency as the most important regarding information retrievalmeasures and matching differences across LR, SVM-RBF, and GBM. Berger and Kompan (2019) also presentnotable classification performance gains when expanding the base user model with analogous attributes. TheCategory & item and Date & time groups displayed moderate relevance when coupled with SVM-RBF or GBM;nevertheless, they were underwhelming when adjusted for the number of elements. This problem might bealleviated with variable preselection, dense encodings, and additional feature engineering. Correspondingly,Gordini and Veglio (2017) associate transactional preferences with churn events. Monetary & Other characteristicsseemed inferior. There does not appear to be general agreement on the importance of the former set; e.g., Bergerand Kompan (2019) present contradictory results while introducing the Monetary features.Our findings support some of the standard dimensions of customer analytics and expose the possible value ofpreference and date-time behavioural patterns. Further local comprehension of suitable modeling pipelines mayassist retention management professionals in leveraging imprinted inclinations to formulate personalized valuepropositions and campaign schedules. The global interpretation might expose problematic product segments orunsatisfactory user experience. Other directions for future research may involve a broader spectrum of businesscontexts. Other feature groups can inform the user model, such as geospatial or perceptual characteristics. Newinsights may be supported by diverse classification learners, hyperparameter optimization, and looser pipelineselection criteria. In addition, future research endeavours might divert from predictive to causal modeling andexamine the structure of the underlying decision-making process. Schiffman et al. (2012) suggest enlighteningsuch aspiration with the external influences (company and its environment), the process itself (decision stages,experience, psychological aspects), and its outputs (purchase or usage, post-evaluation); the redirection mayfurther inform consumer marketing and behavior theory.The model-agnostic set evaluation procedure balances aspects of effects on predictive performance and overallquality. It also accounts for interactions amongst the explained variables. Unfortunately, the impact on performanceis assessed indirectly. Other shortcomings include the arbitrary size of the most influential group or the omissionof its inner rankings. Thus, we suggest further expansion with comprehensive sensitivity analysis and rank-awaremetrics.ConclusionsOver the last twenty years, technological innovations and the transition towards user-centric thinking have fueledthe rise of the retail e-commerce sector. It has become imperative to maintain a healthy user/customer basethrough retention management. Churn prediction informs both short- and long-term retention pursuits and reliesupon dependent and independent attributes. However, the research literature does not demonstrate agreementon such a user/customer churn model. Thus, we proposed a user churn model suitable for e-commerce retail andinvestigated its properties using auxiliary evaluation. We shaped the model around interactions with the websiteand covered various aspects of user behavior. The indirect assessment of permutation importance was carriedout on unseen data employing the best performing solutions, namely, LR, SVM-RBF, and GBM.Individual importance acknowledged the period from the last session, the average period between the sessions,and the number of sessions as the essential features. Similarly, the set perspective recognized the importance ofrecency and frequency characteristics concerning information retrieval metrics and matching differences acrossthe relevant modeling pipelines. Furthermore, SVM-RBF and GBM learners supported new feature groups suchas Category & Item or Date & time. The remaining sets manifested poor associations with the classificationperformance. The findings might also inform retention management endeavours, e.g., personalized campaigns oruser experience enhancements. Other contributions include the original set evaluation procedure and the opendataset.Future research may address the limitations of our work with broader investigation across multiple businesscontexts. The user model can be informed by other feature groups. In addition, we suggest interpreting theunderlying associations using partial-dependence plots, Shapley values, or surrogate models. New insights mayalso be supported by employing diverse classification learners, hyperparameter optimization, and looser pipelineselection criteria. In addition, future scientific efforts may turn away from predictive to causal modeling andinvestigate the structure of the underlying decision-making process; the shift may inform consumer marketing andbehavior theory.The set evaluation procedure might be notably extended with information retrieval metrics directly linked to the\\nPage 11\\n11 SciPap 30(1)solutions\\' predictive performance and inner importance ranks. Furthermore, a thorough sensitivity analysis mightbe advisable.Supplementary Materials:Code: https://github.com/fridrichmrtn/user-churn-model-ecommerce-retailDataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fridrichmrtn/user-churn-datasetReferencesAbbasi, A., Lau, R.
