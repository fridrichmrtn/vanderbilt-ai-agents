    "### Document-as-Implementation Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pattern, agents directly consume **human-readable documents** (e.g., policies) at runtime instead of relying on developers to hardcode business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Hardcoded Logic to Document-as-Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional approach** (policies → developer understanding → code) has challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Translation loss** – nuance lost when converting human rules into code.\n",
    "* **Maintenance challenges** – policies change, but code lags.\n",
    "* **Knowledge silos** – only developers can update system behavior.\n",
    "* **Validation difficulties** – hard to ensure code matches current policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of encoding rules in code, the **document itself becomes the implementation**.\n",
    "Example from invoice agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rules_path = \"config/purchasing_rules.txt\"\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open(rules_path, \"r\") as f:\n",
    "        purchasing_rules = f.read()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    purchasing_rules = \"No rules available. Assume all invoices are compliant.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct use of human knowledge** – policies are applied as-is.\n",
    "2. **Dynamic updates** – system behavior changes when documents update, no redeployment needed.\n",
    "3. **Organizational alignment** – policy owners (compliance, finance, HR) maintain system logic.\n",
    "4. **Traceability & transparency** – clear link between decisions and policy versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beyond Basic File Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Knowledge bases & wikis** – agents draw from organizational knowledge repositories.\n",
    "* **Versioned documents** – enables auditability and compliance.\n",
    "* **Multi-document reasoning** – reconcile multiple sources like a human expert.\n",
    "* **Document-guided workflows** – agents follow SOPs to determine next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Compliance systems** – ensure regulatory alignment in finance.\n",
    "* **Healthcare protocols** – adapt decisions based on clinical guidelines.\n",
    "* **HR policy enforcement** – evaluate requests against official HR docs.\n",
    "* **Customer service** – use FAQs, product manuals, and policies as response sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify **human-readable decision-making documents** in your org.\n",
    "* Treat these docs as **interfaces between experts and AI systems**.\n",
    "* Create **runtime loaders** for current versions.\n",
    "* Design **prompts** that frame documents effectively for LLM reasoning.\n",
    "* Ensure **structured outputs** so downstream systems can use decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The document-as-implementation pattern changes how we build intelligent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Domain experts directly shape system behavior.\n",
    "* Policy changes take effect instantly.\n",
    "* Documentation **is** implementation.\n",
    "* Organizations leverage existing knowledge artifacts without translation loss.\n",
