    "#### Prompting for Expertise with the Persona Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "When building agents that can leverage specialized expertise, we can have the LLM adopt expert personas using the **Persona Pattern**. The `prompt_expert` tool serves as the foundation, enabling interactions with experts who have specific backgrounds and perspectives. Below, we build specialized expert tools for a software development workflow.\n",
