    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 1: Reversible Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "When agents interact with the real world, mistakes can happen. Even if an agent makes the right decision based on available information, external circumstances can change and make the action undesirable after it’s taken. **Reversible actions** provide a safety net, allowing us to “undo” operations when things go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to making actions reversible is capturing enough information during execution to fully reverse the operation later. This isn’t always straightforward—e.g., deleting a calendar event is easy to reverse if you saved all event details, but reversing an email that’s already been read requires careful thought about what “reversal” means in your system. Sometimes, the best we can do is send a follow-up correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure for reversible actions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from datetime import datetime\n",

    "class ReversibleAction:\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern 2: Transaction Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Real tasks often require multiple coordinated actions (e.g., check availability → create event → send notifications). **Transaction management** lets us treat these related actions as a single unit that either completely succeeds or completely fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined with reversible actions, if any step in a multi-step process fails, we can automatically roll back all previous steps. This prevents inconsistent states (e.g., an event exists but notifications weren’t sent, or notifications were sent but the event wasn’t created).\n",

    "### Pattern 3: Staged Execution with Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want more control than just automatic rollback on failure. **Staged execution** allows us to plan a series of actions, review them for safety/correctness, and only then execute them. This is valuable when some actions are less reversible than others or when we want a human (or a more capable AI) to review plans before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The review phase can catch problems that might not be apparent when looking at individual actions (e.g., a valid set of steps that together would overwhelm a team’s schedule or violate policy). It also enables optimization (e.g., finding a more efficient sequence).\n",
