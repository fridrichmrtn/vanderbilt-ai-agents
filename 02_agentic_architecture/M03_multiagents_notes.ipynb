    "* The `call_agent` tool allows seamless collaboration between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `call_agent` Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory Isolation:** Each invoked agent gets its own memory instance, preventing confusion between different agents’ conversation histories.\n",
    "* **Context Management:** Carefully control what context properties are passed to the invoked agent, preventing infinite recursion while ensuring necessary resources are available.\n",
    "* **Result Handling:** Extract the final memory item as the result, providing a clean way to return information to the calling agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Registering Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this system work, we need to register our agents in the registry:\n",

    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.agents = {}\n",

    "    def register_agent(self, name: str, run_function: callable):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Register an agent's run function.\"\"\"\n",
    "        self.agents[name] = run_function\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def get_agent(self, name: str) -> callable:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Get an agent's run function by name.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return self.agents.get(name)\n",

    "registry.register_agent(\"scheduler_agent\", scheduler_agent.run)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Include registry in action context\n",
    "action_context = ActionContext({\n",

    "    # Other shared resources...\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ActionContext and Delegation Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ActionContext` provides a clean way to make the agent registry available to the `call_agent` tool without exposing it directly to all tools. When an agent needs to delegate a task, it simply uses the tool like any other, and the environment system handles the details of finding and invoking the right agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture allows us to build complex multi-agent systems where each agent maintains its specialization while being able to collaborate with other agents when needed. The memory isolation ensures that each agent works with a clean context, while the result extraction provides a standard way to pass information back to the calling agent.\n"

    "### Memory Interaction Patterns in Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "When agents work together, how they share and manage memory dramatically affects their collaboration. Let’s explore different patterns for memory interaction between agents, understanding when each pattern is most useful and how to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Message Passing: The Basic Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of agent interaction is message passing, where one agent sends a request and receives a response. This is like sending an email to a colleague — they get your message, do some work, and send back their results. You don’t see how they arrived at their answer; you just get their final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@register_tool()\n",
    "def call_agent(action_context: ActionContext, \n",
    "               agent_name: str, \n",
    "               task: str) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Basic message passing between agents.\"\"\"\n",
    "    agent_registry = action_context.get_agent_registry()\n",
    "    agent_run = agent_registry.get_agent(agent_name)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Create fresh memory for the invoked agent\n",
    "    invoked_memory = Memory()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Run agent and get result\n",
    "    result_memory = agent_run(\n",
    "        user_input=task,\n",
    "        memory=invoked_memory\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Return only the final memory item\n",
    "    return {\n",
    "        \"result\": result_memory.items[-1].get(\"content\", \"No result\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern works well when the first agent only needs the final answer, not the reasoning process. For example, if a project manager agent asks a scheduling agent to find a meeting time, it might only need to know when the meeting was scheduled, not how the time was chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Reflection: Learning from the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want the first agent to understand how the second agent reached its conclusion. This is like asking a colleague to not just give you their answer, but to explain their thought process. We can achieve this by copying all of the second agent’s memories back to the first agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@register_tool()\n",
    "def call_agent_with_reflection(action_context: ActionContext, \n",
    "                             agent_name: str, \n",
    "                             task: str) -> dict:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Call agent and receive their full thought process.\"\"\"\n",
    "    agent_registry = action_context.get_agent_registry()\n",
    "    agent_run = agent_registry.get_agent(agent_name)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Create fresh memory for invoked agent\n",
    "    invoked_memory = Memory()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Run agent\n",
    "    result_memory = agent_run(\n",
    "        user_input=task,\n",
    "        memory=invoked_memory\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Get the caller's memory\n",
    "    caller_memory = action_context.get_memory()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Add all memories from invoked agent to caller\n",
    "    # although we could leave off the last memory to\n",
    "    # avoid duplication\n",
    "    for memory_item in result_memory.items:\n",
    "        caller_memory.add_memory({\n",
    "            \"type\": f\"{agent_name}_thought\",  # Mark source of memory\n",
    "            \"content\": memory_item[\"content\"]\n",
    "        })\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return {\n",
    "        \"result\": result_memory.items[-1].get(\"content\", \"No result\"),\n",
    "        \"memories_added\": len(result_memory.items)\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is valuable when the first agent needs to understand the reasoning process. For instance, if a research coordinator agent asks a data analysis agent to study some results, seeing the analysis process helps the coordinator better understand and use the conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Handoff: Continuing the Conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want the second agent to pick up where the first agent left off, with full context of what’s happened so far. This is like having a colleague step in to take over a project — they need to know everything that’s happened up to that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@register_tool()\n",

    "```\n",

    "#### Why this helps\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each memory gets a unique ID for precise reference.\n",
    "* The LLM reviews all memories in the context of the task and selects only what’s relevant.\n",
    "* Structured JSON captures both the selection and the reasoning, increasing transparency.\n",
    "* The originating agent retains a record of what was shared and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example memory contents:\n",
    "memories = [\n",
    "    {\"type\": \"user\", \"content\": \"We need to build a new reporting dashboard\"},\n",
    "    {\"type\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Initial cost estimate: $50,000\"},\n",
    "    {\"type\": \"user\", \"content\": \"That seems high\"},\n",
    "    {\"type\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Breakdown: $20k development, $15k design...\"},\n",
    "    {\"type\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Project deadline updated to Q3\"},\n",
    "    {\"type\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Can we reduce the cost?\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"selected_memories\": [\"mem_1\", \"mem_3\", \"mem_5\"],\n",
    "  \"reasoning\": \"Selected memories containing cost information and the request for cost reduction, excluding project timeline and general discussion as they're not directly relevant to the budget review task.\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages over rule-based filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understands context and implications rather than only pattern matching.\n",
    "* Preserves human-readable reasoning for auditability.\n",
    "* Adapts across tasks without code changes.\n",
    "* Keeps sensitive or irrelevant history out of scope for downstream agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need targeted context for a specialist agent (e.g., budget review) without overwhelming it with full history.\n",
    "* You want traceability of what was shared and the rationale.\n",
    "* You must reduce noise while maintaining performance and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap of the four memory-sharing patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Message passing:** simple request/response with only final answer.\n",
    "* **Memory reflection:** caller learns from the callee’s full process.\n",
    "* **Memory handoff:** callee continues with the caller’s full context.\n",
    "* **Selective memory sharing (this pattern):** provide only the most relevant context chosen by an LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing the right pattern — key questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much context does the second agent need?\n",
    "* Does the first agent need to understand the second agent’s process?\n",
    "* Should the conversation history be preserved or minimized?\n",
    "* Is there sensitive or irrelevant information to filter?\n"
