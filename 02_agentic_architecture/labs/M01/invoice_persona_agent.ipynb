    "# A Complete Persona Pattern Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous tutorial, we built an **Invoice Processing Agent** that could extract and store structured invoice data.  \n",
    "Now, we will enhance this system by introducing **expert consultations** to handle two critical tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorizing Expenditures**: The agent will consult an expert to classify each invoice into one of 20 predefined spending categories based on a one-sentence description.  \n",
    "2. **Checking Purchasing Rules**: The agent will validate whether the invoice follows company purchasing policies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By using expert tools, we enable our agent to dynamically invoke specialized knowledge without hardcoding every rule, keeping the architecture clean and adaptable.  \n"
